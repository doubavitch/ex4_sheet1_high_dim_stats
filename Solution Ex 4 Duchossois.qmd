### Question 1: Build the linear regression model Yi = b0 + b1ti + Îµi and estimate b0 and b1.
```{r}
# Create a tibble (dataframe) containing the data collected:
data <- tibble(
  bpm = c(200, 195, 200, 190, 188, 180, 185, 180, 163, 170),
  age = c(10, 20, 21, 25, 29, 30, 31, 40, 45, 50))

# Building the linear regression model
model <- lm(bpm ~ age, data = data)

# Estimate coefficients b0 and b1
b0 <- coef(model)[1]
b1 <- coef(model)[2]

# Printing coefficients
cat("Estimated coefficients:\n")
cat("b0 (intercept):", b0, "\n")
cat("b1 (slope):", b1, "\n")

```

```{r}
# Hypothesis testing
summary(model)  # This provides the hypothesis testing results
```
